- Once a String object has been created, you cannot change the characters that comprises the String. It will create a new object if you try to do so.

- For those cases in which a modifiable String is required, Java provides two options:__StringBuffer and StringBuilder__

- String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder are defined in __java.lang__, so they are automatically available to any class.

- All of the 3 implements __CharSequence__ interface.
